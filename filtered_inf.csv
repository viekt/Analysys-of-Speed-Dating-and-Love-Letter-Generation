When our lover leaves us, we feel vexed and vacant because we recognize that they took up such a large part of what made us feel intoxicated with life.

Our movement may be one of a few days duration and full of pleasure — and it may be one of severe conflict and death to me. <NAME> my will, 
but thine 0 <NAME> be done. If it is necessary that I should fall on the battlefield for my country, I am ready. I have no misgivings about,

But, my dear wife, when I know that with my own joys I lay down nearly all of yours, and replace them in this life with cares and sorrows — 
when, after having eaten for long years the bitter fruit of orphanage myself, I must offer it as their only sustenance to my dear little 
children — is it weak or dishonorable, while the banner of my purpose floats calmly and proudly in the breeze, that my unbounded love 
for you, my darling wife and children, should struggle in fierce, though useless, contest with my love of country?
I cannot describe to you my feelings on this calm summer night, when two thousand men are sleeping around me, many of them enjoying the 
last, perhaps, before that of death — and I, suspicious that <NAME> is creeping behind me with his fatal dart, am communing with <NAME> my 
country, and thee.
I have sought most closely and diligently, and often in my breast, for a wrong motive in thus hazarding the happiness of those I loved 
and I could not find one. A pure love of my country and of the principles have often advocated before the people and “the name of honor 
that I love more than I fear death” have called upon me, and I have obeyed.
<NAME> my love for you is deathless, it seems to bind me to you with mighty cables that nothing but <NAME> could break; and yet my 
love of <NAME> comes over me like a strong wind and bears me irresistibly on with all these chains to the battlefield.

enjoyed them so long. <NAME> hard it is for me to give them up and burn to ashes the hopes of future years, when <NAME> willing, we might still 
have lived and loved together and seen our sons grow up to honorable manhood around us. I have, I know, but few and small claims upon 
<NAME> <NAME> but something whispers to me — perhaps it is the wafted prayer of my little <NAME> — that I shall return to my loved 
ones unharmed. If I do not, my dear <NAME> never forget how much I love you, and when my last breath escapes me on the battlefield, it 
will whisper your name.
Forgive my many faults, and the many pains I have caused you. <NAME> thoughtless and foolish I have oftentimes been! <NAME> gladly would I wash 
out with my tears every little spot upon your happiness, and struggle with all the misfortune of this world, to shield you and my children 
from harm. But I cannot. I must watch you from the spirit land and hover near you, while you buffet the storms with your precious little 
freight, and wait with sad patience till we meet to part no more.
But, O <NAME> If the dead can come back to this earth and flit unseen around those they loved, I shall always be near you; in the garish 
day and in the darkest night — amidst your happiest scenes and gloomiest hours — always, always; and if there be a soft breeze upon your 
cheek, it shall be my breath; or the cool air fans your throbbing temple, it shall be my spirit passing by.
<NAME> do not mourn me dead; think I am gone and wait for thee, for we shall meet again.
As for my little boys, they will grow as I have done, and never know a father’s love and care. <NAME> is too young to remember 
me long, and my blue-eyed <NAME> will keep my frolics with him among the dimmest memories of his childhood. <NAME> I have unlimited

is & shall be most sacred to you, till I am nothing.

it’s the hair.” <NAME> he looked rather grave, and said, “<NAME> I understand: you’ve been playing too many hairs on the pianoforte.”
“<NAME> indeed I haven’t!” I said, “and it isn’t exactly the hair: it’s more about the nose and chin.” <NAME> he looked a good deal graver,

<NAME> you think it’s in the lips?” “Of course!” I said. “<NAME> exactly what it is!”
<NAME> he looked very grave indeed, and said, “I think you must have been giving too many kisses.” “Well,” I said, “I did give one kiss 
to a baby child, a little friend of mine.”
“<NAME> again,” he said; “are you sure it was only one?” I thought again, and said, “<NAME> it was eleven times.” <NAME> the doctor said, 
“<NAME> must not give her any more till your lips are quite rested again.” “But what am I to do?” I said, “because you see, I owe her a

…I was at that date of marriage a very different being from what I am now and stood in relation to my <NAME> Father in a very 
different attitude. <NAME> whole desire was to live in love, absorbing passionate devotion to one person. Our separation was my first 
trial — but then came a note of comfort in the hope of being a mother. <NAME> creature ever so longed to see the face of a little one 
or had such a heart full of love to bestow. <NAME> came in trial again sickness, pain, perplexity, constant discouragement — wearing 
wasting days and nights — a cross, deceitful, unprincipled nurse — husband gone… When you came back you came only to increasing perplexities.
<NAME> how little comfort I had in being a mother — how was all that I proposed met and crossed and my may ever hedged up!
…<NAME> short, <NAME> would teach me that I should make no family be my chief good and portion and bitter as the lesson has been I thank
Him for it from my very soul. One might naturally infer that from the union of two both morbidly sensitive and acute, yet in many respects 
exact opposites — one hasty and impulsive — the other sensitive and brooding — one the very personification of exactness and routine and 
the other to whom everything of the kind was an irksome effort — from all this what should one infer but some painful friction.
But all this would not after all have done so very much had not <NAME> as if intent to try us throws upon the heaviest external 
pressure… but still where you have failed your faults have been to me those of one beloved — of the man who after all would be the 
choice of my heart still were I to choose — for were I now free I should again love just as I did and again feel that I could give up 
all to and for you — and if I do not love never can love again with the blind and unwise love with which I married I love quite as truly 
tho far more wisely…
<NAME> reflecting upon our future union — our marriage — the past obstacles to our happiness — it seems to me that they are of two or three 
kinds. 1st those from physical causes both in you and in me — such on your part as hypochondriac morbid instability for which the only 
remedy is physical care and attention to the laws of health — and on my part an excess of sensitiveness and of confusion and want of 
control of mind and memory. <NAME> always increases on my part in proportion as a I blamed and found fault with and I hope will decrease 
with returning health. I hope that we shall both be impressed with a most solemn sense of the importance of a wise and constant attention 
to the laws of health.
<NAME> in the second place the want of any definite plan of mutual watchfulness, with regard to each other’s improvement, of a definite 
time and place for doing it with a firm determination to improve and be improved by each other — to confess our faults one to another

We have promised each other — haven’t we? — to be at least great friends. If you will only not change your mind! For there are no

Of all those dreams the last is, I believe, the only legitimate one. I mean by that that we are powerless to change the social order 
and, even if we were not, we should not know what to do; in taking action, no matter in what direction, we should never be sure of 
not doing more harm than good, by retarding some inevitable evolution. From the scientific point of view, on the contrary, we may

you will think I push this quality too far, even to severity. But then, please to remember that I have only the outside of a woman, 
and that my heart and mind are wholly masculine….
<NAME> I tell you what makes love so dangerous? ‘<NAME> the too high idea we are apt to form it. But to speak the truth, love, considered 
as passion, is merely a blind instinct, that we should rate accordingly. It is an appetite, which inclines us to one object, rather 
than another, without our being able to account for our taste. <NAME> as a bond of friendship, where reason presides, it is no 
longer a passion and loses the very name of love. It becomes esteem: which is indeed a very pleasing appetite, but too tranquil; and 
therefore incapable of rousing you from you present supineness.
If you madly trace the footsteps of our ancient heroes of romance, adopting their extravagant sentiments, you will soon experience, 
that such false chivalry metamorphoses this charming passion into a melancholy folly; nay, often a tragical one: a perfect frenzy! 
but divest it of all the borrowed pomp and opinion, and you will then perceive how much it will contribute both to your happiness and 
pleasure. <NAME> assured that if either reason or knight errantry should be permitted to form the union of our hearts, love would become a 
state of apathy and madness.
<NAME> only way to avoid these extremes, is to pursue the course I pointed out to you. At present you have no occasion for any thing 
more than mere amusement, and believe me, you will not meet it except among women of the character I speak of. <NAME> heart wants 
occupation; and they are framed to supply the void. At least, give my prescription a fair trial, and I will be answerable for the success.

Write to me only once a week, so that your letter arrives on <NAME> — for I cannot endure your daily letters, I am incapable of 
enduring them. For instance, I answer one of your letters, then lie in bed in apparent calm, but my heart beats through my entire

But for this very reason I don’t want to know what you are wearing; it confuses me so much that I cannot deal with life; and that’s why 
I don’t want to know that you are fond of me. If I did, how could I, fool that I am, go on sitting in my office, or here at home, instead 
of leaping onto a train with my eyes shut and opening them only when I am with you? <NAME> there is a sad, sad reason for not doing so. 
To make it short: <NAME> health is only just good enough for myself alone, not good enough for marriage, let alone fatherhood. <NAME> when I

If only I had your answer now! <NAME> how horribly I torment you, and how I compel you, in the stillness of your room, to read this letter, 
as nasty a letter as has ever lain on your desk! <NAME> it strikes me sometimes that I prey like a spectre on your felicitous name! 
If only I had mailed <NAME> letter, in which I implored you never to write to me again, and in which I gave a similar promise. 
<NAME> what prevented me from sending that letter? <NAME> would be well. But is a peaceful solution possible now? Would it help if we

clustering round my heart, as I read this morning – reminding myself, every now and then, that the writer loved me.
<NAME> is often expressive of a meaning I do not now intend to give, I would describe one of those moments, when the senses are 
exactly tuned by the ringing tenderness of the heart and according reason entices you to live in the present moment, regardless of 
the past or future – it is not rapture – it is sublime tranquility.
I have felt it in your arms – hush!  <NAME> not the light see, I was going to say hear it – these confessions should only be uttered – 
you know where, when the curtains are up – and all the world shut out – <NAME> me!
I wish I may find you at home when I carry this letter to drop it in the box, – that I may drop a kiss with it into your heart, to 
be embalmed, till me meet, closer.",Unknown
"Dearest <NAME>, To <NAME>
<NAME> now listen to me in turn. <NAME> have touched me more profoundly than I thought even you could have touched me – my heart was full 
when you came here today. <NAME> I am yours for everything….
